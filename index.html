it is so easy to speak out the hardest thing in front of you, the things i cannot even think about, in my head.
thankyou for always listening to my useless jokes (and laughing on them) and tolerating me when I randomly start  ranting. <br>
"In the world so high,
you're the one I got,
to the end of sky,
I love you a lot."
     i love you so much, and keep bullying me ;p
